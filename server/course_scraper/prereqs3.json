        "outline": "The goal of this course is\nto deepen your understanding of data structures and algorithms\nand how these can be employed effectively\nin the design of software systems.\nIt is an important course in covering\na range of core data structures and algorithms\nthat will be used in context in later courses.\nYou explore these ideas in lectres, tutorials, lab classes, and assignments.\nAssessment involves labs, tutes, practical lab exams, a practical final exam, and a theory exam.\nAt the end of the course, we want you to be a solid programmer, with knowledge of a range of useful\ndata structures and programming techniques, capable of building significant\nsoftware systems in a team environment, and ready to continue with further specialised studies in computing.Topics:\nAn introduction the structure, analysis and usage\nof a range of fundamental data types and\nthe core algorithms that operate on them, including:\nalgorithm analysis, sorting, searching, trees,\ngraphs, files, algorithmic strategies,\nanalysis and measurement of programs.\nLabs and programming assignments in C,\nusing a range of Unix tools.Executive SummaryA summary of the critical things to know about COMP2521:attempt all of the labs, tutorials, and assignments yourselfalways try to produce a better program than last timein lectures, think critically about what's being said/shownthe textbook is a useful reference source beyond this courseassessment: labs: 8%, assignments: 22%, midterm exam: 10%, final exam: 60%enjoy the course!Now, please read the rest of this document.Course TimetableThe complete course timetable is available at:webcms3:/timetableCourse AimsThe aim of this course is\nto get you tothink like a computer scientist.\nThis certainly sounds like a noble goal...\nbut what does it really mean?\nHow does ascientist,\nlet alone a computer scientist,\nactually think?What many types of scientists try to do\nis understand natural systems and processes:\na geologist, for example,\ntries to understand the structure of the earth;\na biologist tries to understand living organisms;\na chemist tries to understand materials and reactions,\nand so on.Computer scientists don't,\nas the name might suggest,\nsimply try to understand\nthe structure and behaviour of computers,\nbut are more concerned with\nunderstanding software systems\n(and the interaction between\nthe software and the hardware on which it runs).\nAlso, unlike other scientists,\ncomputer scientists frequently build\nthe objects that they study.During this course, we'll be looking at\nways of creating, analysing and understanding software.\nUltimately, you should be able to answer the question,is this piece of software any good?and be able to provide sound reasons to justify your answer.This course follows on from introductory C programming courses:\nCOMP1511, COMP1917, or COMP1921.\nWe cover additional aspects of the C programming language\nthat were not covered in those courses,\nand also look at some programming tools\nwhich were not covered (in detail) earlier.\nHowever, this course is not simply\na second C programming course:\nthe focus is on the ideas and abstractions\nbehind the data structures and algorithms that are used.COMP2521 is a critical course\nin the study of computing at UNSW,\nsince it deals with many concepts that are\ncentral to future studies in the area.\nWhether you are studying Computer Science,\nSoftware Engineering, Bioinformatics,\nComputer Engineering,\nor even a discipline outside the realm of computing,\nunderstanding a range of algorithms and data structures\nand how to use them\nwill make you a much more effective\ncomputing problem solver in the future.Student Learning Outcomes",

Lectures will revolve\naround live demonstrations of programming and use of tools.\nLabs and assignments form a key part.On top of this, the course is not just about the specific technical\naspects of Programming, but also a preparation for studying Computer Science\nand the thought processes and skills necessary for a career in the field.Teaching StrategiesLecturesLectures will be used to present the theory and\npractice of the techniques and tools in this course. There will be\nextensive use of  practical demonstrations during\nlectures. Lecture notes will be available on the course web pages\nbefore each lecture.TutorialsFrom week 1 you will also be expected to attend a one-hour tutorial\nsession to clarify ideas from lectures and work through exercises\nbased on the lecture material. You should make sure that you use them\neffectively by examining in advance the material to be covered in each\nweek's tutorial, by asking questions, by offering suggestions and by generally\nparticipating. The tutorial questions will be posted on the Web in the\nweek before each tutorial.  There are no marks for tutorial attendance.Laboratory ClassesFollowing the tutorial class each week, there will be a two-hour laboratory class,\nduring which you will work on a variety of small practical problems\ninvolving the tools introduced in lectures.\nBecause this course is practical in nature, laboratory classes are a very\nimportant component. If you do not put a great deal of effort into the lab classes\nyou risk failing the final exam.Each week, there will be several exercises to work on. These exercises will be\nreleased in the week preceding the lab class.Most lab exercises will be done in\npairs, and you and you partner should discuss the exercises before the lab to\nmaximise the usefulness of the class.Tutors  will facilitate you forming pairs in your week 1 lab (which is not\nassessed). The pairs will change twice during session.Starting week 3, pairs will also be asked to do code reviews in the tutorials,\nto explain how they tackled a particular problem and describe interesting\nfeatures of their solution.OverviewLab exercises will be automarked (marked automatically by a computer),\nso that tutors can spend lab time assisting students rather than marking\nlabs.SubmissionFor each of the lab exercises,bothmembers of each lab pair need\nto submit the exerciseseparatelyusinggive.You cannot obtain marks by e-mailing lab work to tutors or lecturers.If you cannot complete the exercise by the end of the lab\nyou may complete it in your own time and submit it using thegivecommandbefore 5pm Monday(Monday 17:00).Challenge ExercisesChallenge exercises may be specified for some labs.Some challenge lab exercises typically will specify that they are individual\nexercises (not to be done with your partner).Challenge exercises may be silly, confusing or unreasonably difficult.Do not worry if you can not complete challenge exercises.Lab MarkingLab exercises will be automarked, using test cases that you haven't seen:\ndifferent to the test casesautotestruns for\nyou.\n\n(Hint: do your own testing as well as runningautotest)There will be partial marks for attempts which fail some of these\nautomated tests.AutomarkingAutomarking will be run several days after the submission deadline\nfor the lab. When it  is complete you should be able toview it hereor by running this command on a CSE machine:1511 classrun -collect exercise_nameLab MarksWhen all components of a lab  are automarked you should be able to view the\nthe marksvia give's web interfaceor by running this command on a CSE machine:1511 classrun -sturecThere will be more lab marks available than necessary\nto obtain full marks for the 13% lab component.\nIn other words: total lab marks will be capped.The lab exercises for week are worth in total 2 marks.Except there are no marks for the week 1 lab.Usually each lab exercise will be worth the same - for example if\nthere are 5 lab exercises each will be worth 0.4 marks.Except challenge exercises (see below) will never total more than 20% of each week's lab mark.The best 8 of your 9 lab marks for weeks 2-10, will be summed to give you a mark out of 13.If their sum exceeds 13 - your total mark will be capped at 13.Hence:You can miss 1 lab without affecting your mark.You can obtain full marks for the lab component without doing any challenge exercises.Help SessionsThere will be consultation sessions starting in week 2 where tutors will be \navailable for one on one help with\nspecific problems and assignment clarification. These sessions are optional and \nwill run at different times during the week, with more sessions available \naround assignment deadlines and in later weeks of the term. Check the course\ntimetable for what Help Sessions have been scheduled.Live StreamingLive Streaming sessions that you can join from your own computer will be run at\nspecific times in the term when help is needed.\nThese will involve some live problem solving and coding that will \nanswer frequently asked questions as well as show some more examples of specific\ncoding based on student requests. Live participation will allow students to ask\nquestions during the sessions.\nThese sessions will be recorded and available for viewing after they're streamed.\nCheck the course website for a stream schedule.Weekly Coding TestsThere will be 8 weekly coding tests from weeks 3-10 designed to give you timely\n& realistic feedback of your understanding of the course material.These will be conducted in your own time under self-enforced exam-like conditions.Each test will specify the conditions but typically these will includeNo assistance from any person.A time limit (1 hour).No access to materials (written or online) except specified language\n    documentation or man pages.Each coding test will be automatically marked. There will be partial marks for\nattempts which do not pass automatic tests.\n\nHere is an indicative guide:Passes all automatic tests.1/1Fails several automatic tests.0.75/1otherwise0.5/1Your mark for the coding test component will be the sum of your best 7 of 8 test marks.Any deliberate violation of the test conditions will result in a mark of zero\nfor the entire programming test component.The weekly programming test must be completed by Thursday 5pm the week after it is released.AssignmentsThere are two assessable programming assignments. Assignments give you the\nchance to practice what you have learned on relatively large problems (compared\nto the small exercises in the labs).\n\nAssignments are a very important part of this course, therefore it is essential\nthat you attempt them yourself.Assignment 1 (Submission, Week 6)   13%Assignment 2 (Submission, Week 10)  13%The assignment weighting and deadlines may change a little when the assignment\ndesigns are complete.Late assignments submissions will be penalized.  The exact penalty will be\nspecified in the assignment specification - typically it is 2% reduction in maximum\nmark for every hour late.Final ExamThere will be a three-hour primarily practical exam, to be held in the CSE labs\nduring the exam period.  This will be centrally timetabled and appear\nin your UNSW exam timetable.It will contain implementation tasks which will require you to write C programs.\nIt will also contain sections which require you to read code or answer questions.During this exam you will be able to execute, debug and test your answers.\nThe implementation tasks will be similar to those encountered in lab exercisesAssessmentComponentWeightLab Work13%Weekly Tests7%Assignments26%Final Exam  (exam period)54%Supplementary AssessmentStudents will be offered a supplementary exam if they miss the original\nexam due to (documented) illness or misadventure. Applications for Special\nConsideration are handled by UNSW Student Support and Services, not by\nsubject staff.The supplementary exam is scheduled for the week of the 13-17th January 2020.\nIt is your responsibility to be in Sydney and available for the supplementary exam.\nNo alternative will be offered.Student ConductThe Student Code of Conduct (Information,Policy)\nsets out what the University expects from students as members of the UNSW\ncommunity.\n\nAs well as the learning, teaching and research environment, the\nUniversity aims to provide an environment that enables students to achieve\ntheir full potential and to provide an experience consistent with the\nUniversity's values and guiding principles.\n\nA condition of enrolment is that\nstudents inform themselves of the University's rules and policies affecting\nthem, and conduct themselves accordingly.In particular, students have the responsibility to observe standards of equity\nand respect in dealing with every member of the University community.\n\nThis applies to all activities on UNSW premises and all external activities\nrelated to study and research. This includes behaviour in person as well as\nbehaviour on social media, for example Facebook groups set up for the purpose of\ndiscussing UNSW courses or course work.\n\nBehaviour that is considered in breach of the Student Code Policy as\ndiscriminatory, sexually inappropriate, bullying, harassing, invading another's\nprivacy or causing any person to fear for their personal safety is serious\nmisconduct and can lead to severe penalties, including suspension or exclusion\nfrom UNSW.If you have any concerns, you may raise them with your lecturer, or approach\ntheSchool Ethics Officer,Grievance Officer,\nor one of the student representatives.All work submitted for assessment must be your own work.Lab exercises must be completed by you and your partner.Assignments must be completedindividually.Submission of other people's work as your own (plagiarism) has a major impact on\nlearning so we use plagiarism detection software to search for\nmultiply-submitted work.Please note:Submitting part or all of other students' work, with or without acknowledgement,\nis not acceptable.Submitting work written even partly by another person is also not acceptable.Building on ideas and code snippets obtained from public sources, e.g. Stack\nOverflow, is acceptable (unless the assignment/lab forbids this) provided full\nacknowledgement of their resources is made.Discussing approaches to exercises and assignments with other students is quite\nappropriate, but any discussions should remain at the design level, and must not\ninclude program text. Comparison tools will detect any common code across\nthe student body and previous iterations of the course.The safest approach is to work diligently on your own, seeking help from the\nforum or course staff.Submission of work derived from another person, or jointly written with someone\nelse will result in loss of marks and your name being entered on UNSW's\nplagiarism register.\nThis loss of marks often results in the student failing the course.Providing your work to another person will also result in the loss of marks\nand your name being entered on UNSW's plagiarism register.\nDo not provide your work to any other person, even people who are not UNSW students.\nYou will be held responsible for the actions of anyone you provide your work to.Severe or second offences may result in automatic failure or exclusion from UNSW.Make sure you read:the Learning Centre'sexplanation of plagiarism.UNSW's policy regarding academic honesty and plagiarismOther mattersOccupational Health and Safety policiesInformation for students with disabilitiesContact the lecturer ASAP if you have any disabilities that may affect this course.Course Evaluation and DevelopmentEvery semester, COMP1511 student feedback is requested in a survey at the\nend of this course using UNSW's myExperience online survey system.This feedback is used to improve the course materials and their delivery.In the most recent session feedback was very favourable probably as a result of\nchanges based on the previous session's feedback.\n\nFeedback from surveys for COMP1511's previous offerings has resulted in\nchanges to COMP1511 delivery, including introduction of weekly programming tests.\n\nSome lab exercises and lecture topics will be updated to better reflect current\npractice.Students are also encouraged to provide informal feedback during the session,\nand to let the lecturer in charge know of any problems, as soon as they arise.\n\nSuggestions will be listened to very openly, positively, constructively, and\nthankfully, and every reasonable effort will be made to address them.Resources for StudentsNo textbook is required for COMP1511.The optional textbook for the course is:Programming, Problem Solving, and Abstraction with Cby Alistair Moffat,ISBN978\u00a01\u00a074103\u00a0080\u00a03,\nwhich can be purchased from the UNSW Bookshop.COMP1511 19T3: Programming Fundamentalsis brought to you bytheSchool of Computer Science and Engineeringat theUniversity of New South Wales, Sydney.For all enquiries, please email the class account atcs1511@cse.unsw.edu.auCRICOS Provider 00098G",

        "outline": "fundamental programming conceptsthe C programming language & use of a C compilerprogramming styleprogram design and organisation conceptsprogram testing and debuggingCourse AimsThe course aims for students to become proficient in programming using a high level language, C.\nBy its completion that should be able to construct C programs to solve problems.Student Learning OutcomesLO1: Understand fundamental procedural programming concepts including basic data representation.LO2: Design, implement, test and debug complete C programs to solve specified problems.LO3: Understand good practice for program organsation and programming style.This course contributes to the development of the following graduate capabilities:Graduate CapabilityAcquired inScholars capable of independent and collaborative enquiry, rigorous in their analysis, critique and reflection, and able to innovate by applying their knowledge and skills to the solution of novel as well as routine problemstutorials, labs and assignmentsProfessionals capable of ethical, self- directed practice and independent lifelong learninglabs,assignmentsGlobal citizens who are culturally adept and capable of respecting diversity and acting in a socially just and responsible waylectures, tutorials, labsTeaching RationaleThis course has a heavy practical orientation.  Lectures will revolve\naround live demonstrations of programming and use of tools.\nLabs & assignments form a key part.Teaching StrategiesLecturesLectures will be used to present the theory and\npractice of the techniques and tools in this course. There will be\nextensive use of  practical demonstrations during  \nlectures. Lecture notes will be available on the course web pages\nbefore each lecture. Lecture recordings will be available online a short time after the actual lectures.TutorialsFrom week 1 you will also be expected to attend a one-hour tutorial\nsession to clarify ideas from lectures and work through exercises\nbased on the lecture material. You should make sure that you use them\neffectively by examining in advance the material to be covered in each\nweek's tute, by asking questions, by offering suggestions and by generally\nparticipating. The tutorial questions will be posted on the Web in the\nweek before each tute.  There are no marks for tutorial attendance.Laboratory ClassesFollowing the tute class each week, there will be a two-hour lab class,\nduring which you will work on a variety of small practical problems\ninvolving the tools introduced in lectures.\nBecause this course is practical in nature, lab class are a very\nimportant component, and you should make every effort to attend \nthe labs and complete the exercises diligently.\nIn particular,keep up-to-datewith the Lab work; if you fall\nbehind it affects your ability to understand later material in the\ncourse.To obtain a mark for a lab exercise you must both demonstrate the completed lab exercise to your tutor during a lab class and submit it using give.If you don't complete a lab exercise during the scheduled class, you can still obtain the mark if you both submit the completed exercises before midnight Sunday and you demonstrate it to you tutor in the follow week's lab.Lab exercises will be assessed using the following grade system:GradeMarkCriteriaA+1.25Complete, correct solution with perfect styleA1Competent solution to core part of lab -  any problems or bugs must be minorB0.5Incomplete solution, or complete with significant defects or obvious bugsC0.25Partial solution only, minimal achievement; or inability to explain solutionD or .0Not attemptedChallenge exercises are optional to attempt/complete. Completing challenge exercises can help boost your lab mark. For example, if you get an A for all non-challenge exercises (because you made a couple of mistakes), then if you also complete the challenge exercise that can be your path to an A+ instead of further improving the other non-challenge exercises.Your lab marks (there will be 9 labs in total) will be summed and capped at 8 marks. These 8 marks will contribute 10% of your overall course mark as per the assessment section below.AssignmentsThere are two assessable programming assignments. Assignments give you the chance to practice what you have learnt on relatively large problems (compared to the small exercises in the labs). Assignments are a very important part of this course, therefore it is essential that you attempt them yourself.Assignment 1 (Submission, Week 5) \t15%Assignment 2 (Submission, Week 9) \t15%The deadlines may be slightly varied when the assignment designs are complete\nand to fit best with the lecture schedule.Late programming assignments will be penalized.  The exact penalty will be \nspecified in the assignment specification - often it is 2% reduction in maximum\nmark for every hour late.ExamThere will be a three-hour exam, to be held in the CSE labs\nduring the exam period.\nIt consists of  small implementation tasks which will require you to write C programs,\nand some theory questions. All questions will be answered and submitted on a computer. There is no handwritten component.During this exam you will be able to execute, debug and test your programs.\nThe implementation tasks will be similar to those encountered in lab exercisesIt  is a hurdle requirement for this course that you perform satisfactorily\non the implementation tasks in the exam.  Satisfactory performance is\ndefined as  solving two of the small implementation tasks.The exact  exam format (exam skeleton) will be released in week 13\nbut it is likely there will be 4 implementation tasks.AssessmentComponentValueContributes to Learning OutcomesLab Work10%LO1,LO2,LO3Assignments30%LO1,LO2,LO3Exam60%LO1As mentioned above, your performance on the practical component\nof the final exam must also be satisfactory to pass the course.The lecturer may scale overall marks, or individual components, up or down to\nobtain a desired mark distribution (don't panic - scaling marks down is very rare).Supplementary ExamsThe document\"Essential Advice for CSE Students\"states the supplementary assessment policy for the School of CSE. Please take the time to read it carefully.If you are granted a Supplementary examination, then it will be held on the date specified in the above document. If you think that you may be eligible for a supplementary exam, then make sure you are available on that day. It is your responsibility to check at the School Office for details of Supplementary examinations.Content cheduleThe following content schedule is a draft only and is subject to change throughout the session.Week 1Introduction, C BasicsWeek 2Numeric Types and C conditionsWeek 3Loops & FunctionsWeek 4ArraysWeek 5Characters and StringsWeek 6Pointers and memoryWeek 7StructsWeek 8Stacks and queuesWeek 10Bonus / Extension contentWeek 11Exam RevisionCourse evaluation and developmentEvery semester, COMP1911 Student feedback is requested in a survey at the end of this course\nusing UNSW's CATEI online survey system.This feedback is used to improve the course materials & their delivery.Feedback from the last year was very positive. However it was suggested to provide more and better access to sample code and better practice material for the exam.Resources for StudentsInformation for students with disabilitiesTalk to  the lecturer  if you have any disabilities that may affect this course.The optional textbook for the course is:Alistair Moffat,Programming, Problem Solving, and Abstraction with C,Pearson Education, 2012.For pointers to other useful reading material, including documentation\nfor all of the tools used in the practical work, see the course Web pages.Academic Honesty and PlagiarismUNSW has an ongoing commitment to fostering a culture of learning informed by academic integrity. All UNSW staff and students have a responsibility to adhere to this principle of academic integrity. Plagiarism undermines academic integrity and is not tolerated at UNSW. Plagiarism at UNSW is defined as using the words or ideas of others and passing them off as your own.If you haven't done so yet, please take the time to read the full text ofUNSW's policy regarding academic honesty and plagiarismThe pages below describe the policies and procedures in more detail:Student Code PolicyPlagiarism Policy StatementPlagiarism ProcedureStudent Misconduct ProcedureAll work submitted for assessment must be your own work.Lab exercises and assignments must be completedindividually.\nWe regard copying of\nassignments or lab exercises, in whole or part, as a very serious offence.\nWe use plagiarism detection software to search for\nmultiply-submitted work.Submitting part or all of other students' work, with or without acknowledgement, is not acceptable.Submitting solutions written by other persons is also not acceptable.Building on ideas and partial solutions obtained from public sources, such as web resources, may be acceptable, provided full acknowledgement is made. However, the final mark will take into account the starting point and how much development work would have been required. Failing to acknowledge web or other resources is unacceptable.Discussing approaches to solutions with other students is quite appropriate, but any discussions should remain at the design level, and must not include program text. Comparison tools will detect any common code across the student body.The safest approach is to work diligently on your own, seeking help from the forum or course staff.",

The complexity of systems is typically too high to be manageable by informal reasoning or reasoning that is not tool supported. The formal methods community has developed various rigorous, mathematically sound techniques and tools that allow the automatic analysis of systems and software. The application of these fully automatic techniques is typically called algorithmic verification. The course will describe several automatic verification techniques, the algorithms they are based on, and the tools that support them. We will discuss examples to which the techniques have been applied, and provide experience with the use of several state-of-the-art analysis tools.\n\nThe topics covered by the lectures will educate students on the foundations of automata theory and temporal logics, LTL and CTL model checking techniques and model checking tools, the application of static analysis techniques to program verification, and modern advanced verification techniques for timed and probabilistic systems.",

The formal methods community has developed various rigorous, mathematically sound techniques and tools that allow the automatic analysis of systems and software. The application of these fully automatic techniques is typically called algorithmic verification. The course will describe several automatic verification techniques, the algorithms they are based on, and the tools that support them. We will discuss examples to which the techniques have been applied, and provide experience with the use of several state-of-the-art analysis tools.\n\nThe topics covered by the lectures will educate students on the foundations of automata theory and temporal logics, LTL and CTL model checking techniques and model checking tools, the application of static analysis techniques to program verification, and modern advanced verification techniques for timed and probabilistic systems.",

The knowledge-, service-, and cloudbased economy in parallel with the continuous improvement in connectivity, storage and data\nprocessing capabilities allow access to a data deluge from sensors, social-media, news, usergenerated, government and private data sources. Accordingly, in a modern data-oriented\nlandscape, data-driven applications may need to deal with a collection of data sets - from\nunstructured, relational to NoSQL - that holds a vast amount of information gathered from various\nprivate/open data sources. Therefore, well-engineered service-oriented functionalities are critical\nfor ingesting, organizing and querying the growing volume of data in modern web-based\napplications, as well as recommender systems that can help making decisions.\nThis course aims to introduce the student to core concepts and practical skills for engineering the\ndata in service-oriented data-driven applications. Specifically, the course aims to answer these\nquestions:\n\u2022 How to access and ingest data from various external sources?\n\u2022 How to process and store the data for applications?\n\u2022 How to curate (e.g. Extract, Transform, Correct, Aggregate, and Merge/Split) and\npublish the data?\n\u2022 How to apply available analytics to the data?\n\u2022 How to visualize the data to communicate effectively\n\u2022 How to utilize recent recommender systems to help making decisions?\nFundamentally, we will look at these questions through the lens of 'service-oriented' software\ndesign and implementation principles. At each topic, we will learn some core concepts, and how\nto implement the concepts in software through services. \nThe course uses the Python Programming Language as the practical basis for its modules.\nHowever, the concepts taught are universal and can be applied to any other web development\nframework",

It takes a certain amount of time for a computer to finish the execution of an algorithm. The time to completion (or response time in performance analysis terminology) is a performance metric that computer scientists and computer engineers should be concerned about because no one wants to wait unnecessarily. If you can understand the factors that determine the response time, then you can influence those factors so that the response time is acceptable. This course will take a mathematical modelling and analytical approach to understand response time in computer systems and networks. The primary goal is to explore how mathematical modelling and mathematical methods can be used to model, analyse and design computer systems and networks so that they have good performance. There are three major topics that will be covered by this course:Queuing analysis (Note: Queues are important because they give rise to waiting time.)Discrete event simulationInteger programming for network design",

        "outline": "This Course Aims to expose its students to the large conceptual resource of essentially logical and mathematical material underlying the construction of correct, usable and reliable software. Much of this has been \u201clost\u201d in the sense that it is taught either as hard-core theory (with the expected effect on its popularity) or \u2013worse\u2013 not taught at all. Thus there will be three main threads running through the course: (1) how to think about (correctness of) programs; (2) case studies of how others have done so; and (3) what are the supporting theories, and where would further study of them lead.\n\nFor (1) the main theme will be the use of static rather than operational reasoning, that is thinking about what is true at various points in a program rather than on what the program \u201cdoes\u201d as its control moves from one point to another. This is harder than it sounds, and it takes lots of practice.\nThe principal tools, for conventional programs, are assertions, invariants and variants. (Google for them.) Usually these are presented with an emphasis on formal predicate calculus, and precise step-by-step logical reasoning. But we instead we will be using them informally, writing our invariants etc. in English and seeing how that affects the way we program and the confidence we have in the result. Further tools are abstraction, refinement, data refinement and program algebra: these techniques are used to transform one program into another one that is just as correct as the first one was, but is (for example) more efficient or more easily implemented on the platform available.\n\nFor (2), the programs we study will be chosen to help us put the ideas of (1) into practice, as they do need lots of practice. Usually the general idea of what the program needs to do will be obvious, but making sure that it works in all cases will seem (at first) to be an almost impossible goal. One\u2019s initial approach is, all too often, simply to try harder to examine every single case; and \u201csuccess\u201d might then be equated with exhaustion of the programmer rather than exhaustion of the cases.\nOur alternative approach to \u201cimpossible\u201d programs will be to try harder to find the right way to think about the problem they are solving \u2014 often the obvious way is not the best way. But getting past the obvious can be painful, and exhausting, though it is rewarding in the end: a crucial advantage of succeeding in this way is that the outcome \u2013the correctness argument\u2013 is concrete, durable and can be communicated to others (e.g. to yourself in six months\u2019 time). Further, the program is much more likely to be correct. And \u2013finally\u2013 it is fun, and extremely satisfying.\n\nIn (3) we recognise that the above (intellectual) tools all have mathematical theories that underlie them; but we will not study those theories for their own sake. Rather we will look into the theories \u2013with a light touch\u2013 to see the way in which they influence the practical methods they support. The theories include program semantics, structured domains, homorphisms, testing and compositionality and finally refinement.\nAt the end there will be a brief look at some new theories behind security, and random algorithms, concentrating on how the main ideas of the course continue to apply. But they will have to be adapted in interesting ways.",

        "outline": "To provide students with a deep understanding of modern operating\nsystem technology, implementation techniques and research issues.Our approach to achieving this goal is to expose students to advanced\ntopics in operating systems via interactive lectures that examine\nspecialist topics, and selected research papers and their\nresults. Further, students undertake a substantial practical project\nwhere they apply their skills to advanced operating system\nconstruction. Together, both components give students an advanced\ntheoretical foundation in operating systems, that is re-enforced\nthrough practical application.This course builds upon the basic operating systems course\n(COMP3231/9201/3891/9283), which provides an understanding of the\nunderlying operating systems which students have implicitly relied\nupon in developing applications in foundational courses within\nComputer Science and Engineering, and will rely on in their future\ncareers when developing systems and applications. Advanced operating\nsystems enables students to specialise in operating systems, giving\nthem the background to become operating systems or embedded-systems\ndevelopers or researchers, either\nthemselves or as part of a team.This course contributes to the the students graduate attributes in\nthe following ways:The challenging project enables student to further develop the\nanalytical skills required to manage system complexity, creative\nproblem solving, and engages student in collaborative and in-depth\napplication of their operating system skills.Regular project demonstrations improve technical communication\nskills.Interactive examination during lectures of relevant research in\nthe field develops critical thinking, and engages students in examples\nof scholarly enquiry.The project also requires students to develop their skills in\nlocating the relevant information required complete the project,\nevaluate the information's relevance to the project, and when\nrequired, digest and apply the information, and self-evaluate their\nown understanding of the material.OBJECTIVESTechnicalProvide in-depth coverage of modern operating system issues, such as:microkernels and IPC,user-level OS servers,design and implementation of microkernel-based systems,performance,kernel design and implementation,device drivers,virtualisation and hypervisors,scheduling for real-time,symmetric multiprocessing and hardware multithreading,effects and control of hardware caches,protection and security models,OS designs and resulting issues,hot topics.EducationalExposing students to current operating systems research and modern\nOS technology.Providing insight in the design principles of very fast kernels.Providing experience in low-level systems programming in a\nrealistic development environment.Providing experience in reading and evaluating research papers.Encouraging interest in further study and research in the area.ProfessionalWorking in an environment and on problems similar to a\nprofessional OS or embedded systems engineer in industry.Designing, implementing and debugging a whole system almost from the hardware up.Learning to cope with system complexity.Understanding\nlowest-level OS code and its interaction with hardware.LEARNING OUTCOMESOn successfully completing the course, students should be capable of:Developing low-level operating system code.Understanding the performance trade-offs in developing\n  high-performance low-level OS code. Specifically:The influence of cache architecture on OS design.The influence of cache coherence models and multicore on OS\n      and sync primitive design and implementation.The influence of execution models on complexity and\n    performance of OS code.Understanding and be capable of developing OS code inside a\n    variety of OS environments, including monolithic, microkernels, and\n    virtual machines, including device drivers.Developing benchmarks to evaluate the performance of OSs and\n  application stacks.Understanding and of evaluating research\n    published in the field of operating system at a level commensurate\n    with their experience.PREREQUISITESGeneralStudents are expected to be highly competent in programming in\nC. Students not familiar with C will be expected to learn it on their\nown (very quickly!)Students are expected to be familiar with assembly\nlanguage programming. The project will not require assembly\nprogramming, but for debugging and understanding of calling conventions\nthis knowledge is required. Furthermore, the lectures will examine\nlow-level kernel code, some of which is written in assembler.Students are expected to be familiar with basic computer architecture\nconcepts and the main characteristics of a modern RISC processor. The\nproject will use anOdroid-C2computer based on the Amlogic S905 SoC containing a quad-core\nCortex-A53 64-bit CPU (ARMv8 ISA).Course Prerequisitesadistinctiongrade inCOMP3231/COMP3891/COMP9201/COMP9283 (Extended) Operating Systems(pre-requisite)CONSTITUENTSLecturesA rough outline of the lectures is (subject to change):Introduction and OverviewIntroduction to the seL4 MicrokernelseL4 system calls, library API and usage (to get you started on the project)Microkernels and User-level ServersHistory and\nmotivation for microkernel systems, Hydra, Mach, discussion,\nexperiences; second-generation microkernel systems;\ndesign and implementation of microkernel-based systems, including\nuser-level page fault handling and device driversMicrokernel ConstructionA detailed look at the design and internals of a real secure and\nhigh-performance microkernel.A close look at selected OS issuesCaching, and its implications for OSEvents vs threadsOS securityVirtual machinesOS research projects at UNSW/Data61Other topics (as time allows)Candidates areComparison of OS designs (L4, Linux, Darwin, Windows)Real-time issuesSMP/SMT issues: locking, cache coherence, schedulingReliable device driversFile systemsHot topicsLaboratories/ProjectLab work forms a major component of the course. This will be carried\nout using a take-home hardware kit that can be used in any of the\nSchool's Linux labs, or on students own machines.In the first lecture, students will be provided with theirOdroid-C2lab kits.The Odroids runseL4, a third-generation microkernel developed from scratch\n  byKevin\n  Elphinstoneand his team, part of theTrustworthy Systemsgroup\n  atData61(formerly NICTA). The kernel is the latest\n  in a series of L4 microkernels designed\n  atKarlsruhe, UNSW and Data61, and has\n  some revolutionary properties which will be disused in class. Most\n  famously, it is the world's first (and so far only) OS kernel with a\n  formalproof\n  of functional correctness; this was done by the ERTOS\n  team under the lead\n  ofGerwin Klein.\n  The ERTOS engineers and research students are mostly alumni of this\n  course.The Odroids connect to Linux hosts running an L4 development\nenvironment. OS code is developed and compiled there and then\ndownloaded to the Odroid, which present a minimum environment ideally\nsuited for low-level systems programming exercises.  Documentation as\nwell as sample code will be provided.After some ``warm-up'' experiments students will work in groups of two\non a project, which constructs various OS components, with the\nultimate aim of producing a small (and very efficient) operating\nsystem. A series of milestones are defined to aid the implementation.Milestones and the final project will be demonstrated to School staff\nand the code submitted for assessment. Complete system documentation\nwill form the final deliverable.Milestones must be demonstrated at a consultation time in the week\nfollowing the week that the milestone is due. Both partners must be\npresent and participate in milestone demonstrations as milestone\ndemonstrations are assessed individually. Milestone deadlines missed\nby no more than one week will cause a loss of 20% of the mark for that\nparticular milestone, if missed by more that one week the penalty is\n40%, up to a maximum of two weeks.No submissions/demos will be accepted later than\ntwo weeks after the deadline.\nFurthermore,students will not be allowed to\ncontinue with the course unless they have given a satisfactory\ndemonstration of the first two milestones\n(m0andm1) within one week of the respective due\ndate!Alternative projects may be given to some students by special\narrangements. The main criteria for this is that the project is at\nleast as challenging as the standard project, and that I am convinced\nthat the student(s) are up to it.CheatingMisconduct and plagiarism in any form will be dealt with consistent\n  with CSE and University policies (seehttp://webapps.cse.unsw.edu.au/cse/student-conduct.html).Final ExamThere will be a final exam, in the form of a24h\ntake-home. Students will be given one day to read and analysetworecent research papers relevant to the material covered in\nthe course, and submit a critical report on it. See theprevious years' examsfor examples.Supplementary assessmentsSupplementary exams will only be awarded in well justified cases, in\naccordance with School policy,notas a second chance for\npoorly performing students. In particular, it is highly unlikely that\na supplementary will be awarded to students who have actually\nsubmitted an exam.Make up your mind whether or not you are sick\nbefore submitting!Supplementary exams will either have the same format as the normal\nexam, or, at the discretion of the LiC, will be orals. They\nwill probably be held on the day after the written supplementary exams\nheld for other courses.ConsultationsSee theconsultation schedule.ASSESSMENTThe project is the heart of this course, which is all about learning\nabout OS design and implementation \u201chands on\u201d. It will\ndominate the workload for the course, and will develop valuable and\nhighly-sought-after systems skills in students. Consequently, the\nproject is the dominating assessment component. The project work\ncounts for 65% of the final mark.Students must\ncontributeequallyto the project work.In the case of\nsignificantly unequal contributions, the marks of the lesser\ncontributor will be reduced.The exam contributes 35% of the final mark.A minimum mark of 14\n(i.e., 40% of the maximum) is required in the exam to receive a\npassing grade.This is to ensure that no-one can pass the course\non project work alone.OTHER ADMINSTRATIVE INFOSurveysWe conduct a detailed on-line survey at the end of each session, in\norder to identify any shortcomings of the course. This has in the\npast helped to maintain and improve the quality of the course.In order to emphasise that we take student comments very seriously, wepublish all surveys uncensored, with the\npossible exception of removing statements other people could find\nupsetting (the LiC isn't easily insulted ;-). In some cases they are\naccompanied by comments by the LiC.Parallel TeachingN/ACredit ValueCOMP9242 is weighted at 6 UoC.Yellow FormExpectations and responsibilities of students, OH&S and equity and\ndiversity issues are covered in the School'sYellow\nFormwhich every student needs to sign.TEXT and REFERENCE BOOKSTextbookThere is no textbook for this course, as no published book covers the\nmaterial in sufficient depth.

While the focus is on relational DBMSs, given that they have the best-developed technological foundation, we will also consider more recent developments in the management of large data repositories.Relational DBMSs need to deal with a variety of issues: storage structures and management, implementation of relational operations, query optimisation, transactions, concurrency, recovery, security. The course will address most of these, along with a brief look at emerging database systems trends. The level of detail on individual topics will vary; some will be covered in significant detail, others will be covered relatively briefly.An important aspect of this course is to give you a chance to undertake an in-depth exploration of the internals of arealDBMS: PostgreSQL. Lectures will discuss the general principles of how DBMSs are implemented, and will also illustrate them with examples from PostgreSQL where possible.",

        "outline": "This course is part the series of software engineering workshops designed to teach students to work\nin teams and apply their knowledge to solve real-life problems. This workshop will offer students the\nopportunity to concentrate on software requirements analysis and design issues including artefacts\nproduced as well techniques and tools to support this process (brainstorming, problem statements,\nrequirements elicitation, producing design documents and prototyping). In addition, it aims to\nprovide students with some of teamwork skills, requirements engineering and design techniques\nthat an engineer would use in the early stages of the development process. The students will also be\ngetting experience on different aspects of designing a Web application with a major focus on the\nfront-end. The requirements for this course will be determined in collaboration with industry\npartners and will relate to developing a realistic application. Most of the teaching will be conducted\nvia mentoring of the teams. At the beginning of the course, some lectures will give background on\nsome key concepts and technologies and on how to produce artefacts in general. The course has a\nnumber of industry sponsors that include Fairfax Media and Macquarie Bank.",
